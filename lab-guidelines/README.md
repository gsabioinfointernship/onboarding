# Mission Statement

Big Bioinformatics Lab (BigBio Lab) is an independent bioinformatics research and training facility based in Bangladesh. Our goal is to address critical public health challenges through cutting-edge data analysis and capacity building in bioinformatics.

## Expectations
**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and career development. As a member of BigBio Lab, you are expected to participate fully in the team. In general, members are expected to follow working hours that include 4 hours/day to facilitate discussion within the group. 

**Mentor Role:** Mentors role is to facilitate your success as well as that of your project. Within your project, mentors will serve as a sounding board for ideas, will help you plan your project, and will help to devise experiments to test your hypotheses. To facilitate your success, mentors will help you to plan your training, to devise a career plan that can take you to where you want to go, to advise you on your project-risk portfolio, and to provide guidance on other elements of career and project development as needed.

**Deadlines:** Our team is working hard to develop a reputation for high-quality science that is well presented. We all benefit from this reputation, but we must also work to maintain it. Abstracts for meetings must be shared with all co-authors, including mentors, at least one week prior to the deadline for submission. Failure to abide by this guideline will result in missing whatever the opportunity in question is.

Trainees in the BigBio Lab will often receive opportunities to present their work at scientific conferences. These presentations reflect on the entire team. Oral presentations on projects must be presented to the research team during a braintrust meeting, and BigBio Lab members are expected to address feedback that is provided. Once a project has been presented once and feedback incorporated, additional presentations are optional in advance of meetings. Poster presentations should be shared in the `#general` slack channel at least a week before printing.

**Code of Conduct:** At BigBio Lab Bangladesh, we are committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and harassment-free environment for all members and visitors. Discrimination or harassment based on gender, gender identity, age, disability, appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic will not be tolerated. This includes offensive comments, inappropriate images, intimidation, stalking, disruption, unwanted physical contact, and sexual advances. All members are expected to adhere to these guidelines, and any harassing behavior must cease immediately when asked. Please refer to the full Code of Conduct for more detailed information on our expectations. We prioritize cooperation to ensure a professional and inclusive atmosphere for everyone.

**Authorship:** Our team follows the [ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) defintions of the roles of authors and contributors to our manuscripts.

**Ethics:** We expect BigBio Lab members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the team. We expect that BigBio Lab members will design experiments/study in a manner that minimizes both bias and self deception. We expect that BigBio Lab members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code and results openly with the scientific community. We expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing. Plagiarism is not tolerated. While a full enumeration of ethical considerations is outside of the scope of this document, BigBio Lab provides a [document](https://github.com/BigBio Labbd/onboarding/blob/main/BigBio Lab%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf) that we recommend.

In addition, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns that you have at any point with the director.


# Communication
## General
**Slack:** BigBio Lab Bangladesh operates remotely and uses Slack for internal communication. Members should prioritize Slack messages over emails for faster response times. If an email is necessary, please ensure it is also acknowledged in Slack. All members should join the following channels: `#general`, `#meeting`, and `#random`. 

**Social Media:** BigBio Lab members are encouraged to share research and updates via public social media. If a member associates their profile with BigBio Lab Bangladesh, they must adhere to the BigBio Lab’s code of conduct. If required by an employer or collaborator, members should include a disclaimer stating that opinions are personal and do not represent BigBio Lab Bangladesh. Please read [Social Media Policies for BigBio Lab Bangladesh](/lab-guidelines/social-media-policies.md). 

**IP/Openness:** Intellectual property and openness policies align with BigBio Lab’s agreements with funding sponsors and institutional policies. Any concerns should be discussed with the director.

**Accounts:** BigBio Lab members must create and maintain accounts for:
- GitHub (organization)
- Slack (workspace)

### Meetings
#### Scrum
Our team's scrum process involves three components:
1. A weekly kick-off meeting at `8:30 AM` `Friday` morning where individuals will lay out their goals for the week on Zoom.
2. A demo day meeting at `8:30 AM` `Saturday` afternoon where team members show off an accomplishment from the week in 3 minutes or fewer. This could be a new figure, section of a paper, some code that they are particularly happy with, or something that we learned from a paper, poster, or research presentation.
3. A daily virtual scrum update on Salck.

We use Google Slides to share figures or paper sections for the demo day meeting; the link is pinned in the `#meeting `channel on Slack and is not intended to be shared outside the lab. 

### Research Meeting 

Research meetings are scheduled for one hour on the third Friday of the month. All members of BigBio Lab Bangladesh are expected to attend. Meetings are designed to provide a supportive environment for learning, constructive criticism, help, and scientific discussions.

## Meeting Agenda
The format of each meeting will be chosen by the meeting lead from the options below. The lead will rotate among members (see below) within the group. Guests with aligned research interests may join with a supermajority vote of lab members (>2/3) and are expected to attend and participate fully.

The lead will choose the format for each meeting. The different options for meeting formats are outlined below. Each member is expected to lead at least four Braintrust meetings per year (2 every 6 months).

### Meeting Formats
#### Format 1: Braintrust
The meeting lead presents their own research/project to the group. Presenters often focus on open questions or challenges in their work. Occasionally, they present a new talk or set of slides that they intend to deliver at a meeting, job talk, etc. This format helps the group become familiar with each other’s work and allows for feedback, advice, or help with research if needed.

#### Format 2: Tech Talk/Discussion
Talks on commonly used technology in the team, strategies for staying on top of the literature, organization, etc.

#### Format 3: Post-Conference Presentations
Journal club talk on a favorite poster/talk. Either from each person or from a selected set that the group votes on.

#### Format 4: Big Ideas or Projects
This format helps senior members practice for paper discussion sections/conclusions while helping newer members see where the boundaries of fields are.

#### Format 5: Journal Club
Presentation to be given by the meeting leader followed by group discussion. The meeting leader should aim to send the chosen paper one week before the scheduled meeting, and lab members are expected to be familiar with the content for discussion.

#### Format 6: Preprint Review
A preprint is discussed by the group. The discussion is led by the meeting leader, and all members are expected to be familiar with the content. The review is written collaboratively, but another member (not the meeting leader) formats, formalizes, and uploads it to the preprint server as a comment.

## Meeting Lead
Each member is expected to sign up as lead by the end of the previous academic semester (e.g., sign up by December for the Spring semester, sign up by June for the Fall semester.)

- Lab meeting sign-ups will happen twice a year (December and June) for the upcoming 6 months.
- Each member will sign up as lead for at least 2 lab meetings each semester (6 months).
- At least one of these meetings is expected to be a Braintrust meeting.

## Ad-Hoc Meetings
After meetings have been scheduled for the semester, any member can add an ad-hoc meeting as needed.

Ad-hoc meetings are intended to help BigBio Lab members get advice and support on projects, prepare for talks, oral exams, etc.


# Source Code, Data, and Reproducibility

## Pride
We expect lab members to sign their code, ensuring that source code contributions are attributable to an individual's account on GitHub. To quote from *The Pragmatic Programmer*:

> Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too… People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well-written, tested, and documented.

While some code may be proof-of-concept, it should always inspire confidence in its quality and reliability.

## Programming Languages
We write analytical code in **Python** or **R** to ensure that all lab members are proficient in both languages. For visualization, **Python, R may be used. 

## Licensing
We release as many research outputs as possible under **permissive open licenses** to maximize reproducibility and accessibility. The **BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License** is the default license for software developed in the lab, as it is **OSI-approved**, simple, and highly compatible. However, certain funding agencies may require different licenses. If there are concerns about licensing, lab members should raise them in Slack.

## Version Control and GitHub Usage
Our primary version control service is **GitHub**, and lab members should maintain their code in repositories under the **BigBio Lab Bangladesh GitHub organization**. To facilitate code review and ensure best practices, the following workflow must be followed:

### Creating a BigBio Lab Repository
1. Create a repository under the BigBio Lab Bangladesh organization.
2. Immediately fork this repository into your user account.
3. Make commits to your personal repository first.
4. Follow the code review process before merging changes into the BigBio Lab repository.

### Code Review Process
Code moves from personal repositories to BigBio Lab repositories via **pull requests**. All changes must go through this review process:

1. Make changes and commit them to your **personal repository**.
2. Create a **pull request (PR)** into the corresponding BigBio Lab repository.
3. Assign reviewers to the PR.
4. At least one lab member must approve the PR before merging.
5. PRs should focus on a **single functional area** to facilitate easier reviews.

Lab members are expected to participate in reviewing pull requests when assigned.

### Handling Projects That Didn't Work
Repositories may contain **failed projects** (e.g., proof-of-concepts that didn’t succeed). Keeping track of these failures helps us **avoid repeating mistakes** and fosters transparency in research.

## Non-Code Versioning
Non-code documents should be stored in a version-controlled environment. BigBio Lab Bangladesh members should use **Google Drive or OneDrive** to maintain version history.

## Data Management
- **Publicly available data**: Scripts used to download and process these data should be preserved and version-controlled.
- **Generated data**: Lab-generated data should be stored in a **replicated location** and uploaded to relevant repositories (e.g., **GEO for gene expression, SRA for sequencing**) as soon as possible.
- **Intermediate files**: Where feasible, reasonable-sized intermediate files should be stored to facilitate re-use, but workflows should always allow data to be regenerated.

## Reproducibility
All code should support **reproducible analyses**. This can be achieved through:

- **Makefiles**, **shell scripts**, or other automation approaches.
- Including scripts for generating figures in manuscripts.
- Ensuring all code is reviewed before the submission of a **preprint** or **manuscript**.

By adhering to these guidelines, BigBio Lab Bangladesh ensures **transparent, high-quality, and reproducible** research practices.
